Project Description
This project is a web application aimed at managing the data related to the Competitive Programming Club at our University. This includes registration of interested users, existing members, and club-related information.

Key Objectives
Public User Login: Develop a login mechanism for users who are neither club members nor part of the administrative team. This section will display information about getting started with competitive programming.

Club Member Login: Create a unique login for registered club members.

Admin Login: Establish an administrator login for club members who are part of the club administration. The administrative interface will provide functionalities like activating, deactivating, and deleting members, teams, and other resources.

Mission
To create an interactive web application that facilitates user registration, team creation, and contest management for the Competitive Programming Club.

Vision
This project is intended to serve as a beta version of a more comprehensive web application that will be developed for the Competitive Programming Club in the near future.

Additional Resources Used (Front-End, Back-End, Database)
